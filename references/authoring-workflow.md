## Intent brief

Start from `templates/intent-brief.json`; its keys are the input contract and its requirement arrays intentionally start empty so placeholders cannot become obligations. Record the problem, positive use cases, near-miss triggers, inputs, outputs, irreversible boundaries, state-dependent behavior, exact formats, external dependencies, evidence of completion, judgment points, and deterministic helpers. Ask only when an answer changes a product boundary or an irreversible action.

Keep a judgment point as a string when every invocation needs it. When a large P0 or P1 skill has a prose topic that applies only under a distinct condition, record it as `{ "id": "stable-kebab-id", "when": "one-line condition", "points": ["preserved requirement", "another requirement"] }`. The profile does not change: conditional prose routing is orthogonal to P0/P1 mechanics. Do not mechanically split prose by length. Use a topic only when its condition is meaningful, its points form one coherent subject, and the always-loaded entry still contains universal boundaries, state-dependent obligations, exact formats, and stop rules.

## Profile selection

- P0: judgment and concise guidance only. Do not create `spec.mjs`.
- P1: exact formats or deterministic helpers, scripts, templates, or validators are useful, but no state machine is required.
- P2: use when state-dependent branches, guards, ordered effects, exact formats, or evidence-gated completion repeat.

Do not choose P2 merely because the source is long. The generator records the selected profile, signals, and reasons in `.skill-rails/profile-decision.json`; `.skill-rails/intent.json` remains the canonical input.

For P0/P1, conditional judgment topics generate a small `references/guidance-index.md` and one Markdown file per stable topic. `SKILL.md` tells the using AI to read the index and open only matching topics. The index owns active routing conditions; topic files own their prose; the obligation ledger points back to both. Plain string judgment points stay in `SKILL.md`. Missing routing material fails lint. This is model-readable progressive disclosure, not a state machine or a host permission boundary.

This contract does not create a second migration ledger or a progressive query layer over migration atoms. It also sets no universal token threshold: `eval.mjs` reports deterministic byte surfaces, while fresh consumer runs must establish whether a model selected the right topics and avoided unrelated ones.

## Creation order

1. Write the intent brief and evaluation cases.
2. Atomize obligations and record their source and consequence.
3. For P2, copy `templates/authoring-card.md` into the work package, complete its observations, judgment inputs, owners, artifacts, and terminals, then project approved decisions into the canonical spec and obligation ledger. The card is an authoring aid, not a second behavior source.
4. Design ASK, WAIT, ROUTE, BLOCK, and DONE terminals first.
5. Define observations and domains.
6. Define guards and bypass evidence.
7. Define stages, tables, effects, and order.
8. Define formats, templates, and examples.
9. Write judgment-only body sections.
10. Add positive, negative, counterexample, and mutation fixtures.
11. Generate the thin loader and platform metadata.
12. If the user requested a README, read [readme-authoring.md](readme-authoring.md) and write it from the implemented behavior and available evidence. Do not treat the guide as a fixed section template.
13. Run L-fast, L-structural lint, L-full build, and behavior evaluation.

The obligation ledger is provenance, not a second behavior source. Keep original intent text immutable inside each atom and point `targets` to the canonical implementation and `evidence` to its check. Supported locators are `file:<relative-path>`, `body:<section-ref>`, `spec:<GROUP>/<stable-id>` (or `spec:TABLES/<table>/<row>`), `fixture:<id>`, and `eval:<id>`. Mark an atom `projected` only after both locators resolve. If an atom is still ambiguous, leave it `review-required` and keep the P2 `DEFERRED` gate.

## Maintenance

Address stable IDs, not prose locations. Before a change, query affected predicates, stages, rows, body sections, templates, owners, fixtures, and generated artifacts. After a change, review the semantic diff as well as the line diff.

For an intent-backed P0/P1 package, pass `maintain.mjs` a change containing only `update-intent` operations. It first refuses to overwrite a `SKILL.md`, adapter, index, or topic file that differs from the current intent-derived projection. Record that meaning in intent or move separately owned material before retrying. It then updates the intent and ledger, regenerates those projections and evaluation cases atomically, and leaves an authored P1 helper or other package files unchanged. For an auto-profiled package, maintenance stops if the updated intent would select a different profile and requires explicit regeneration instead of silently changing package shape. An explicit profile decision remains pinned and auditable. P2 maintenance keeps using stable-ID body, resource, spec, and intent operations followed by its semantic diff and rebuild.

## Completion boundary

Creation is structurally complete only when lint and build pass. Behavior is verified only when forward tests provide evidence. A new skill remains an initial release candidate until real use confirms its trigger, adherence, outputs, and maintenance locality.
